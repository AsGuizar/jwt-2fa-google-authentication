# jwt-2fa-google-authentication
A secure authentication system that combines traditional login mechanisms with advanced security features such as Two-Factor Authentication (2FA), JSON Web Tokens (JWT), and Google Authenticator. 

Features:
User Registration & Login: Secure user registration and login with password hashing using SHA-256 and a salt for added security.
JWT Authentication: Stateless authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to securely identify users.
Two-Factor Authentication (2FA): Optional 2FA using Google Authenticator to provide an additional security layer, requiring a one-time password (OTP) generated by the app.
Brute Force Protection: Limits login attempts to prevent brute force attacks by temporarily blocking users after several failed login attempts.
QR Code for 2FA Setup: Allows users to scan a QR code to set up Google Authenticator for 2FA.
Secure Token Storage: Tokens are stored securely, ensuring safe user sessions.

Tech Stack:
Backend: Node.js, Express.js
Authentication: JWT, Speakeasy (for 2FA), Crypto (for hashing)
Database: Simple JSON-based storage for users (users.json file)
2FA: Google Authenticator integration via Speakeasy
QR Code Generation: qrcode library to generate the 2FA setup QR code

Setup Instructions:
Clone the repository.
Install dependencies using npm install.
Run the server with node server/server.js.
Use the endpoints for user registration, 2FA verification, and login.
